      "If you're looking for a new twist on your traditional dishes, stop by our grocery store and Tasting Rooms for free samples. Roasted Pumpkin Seed Oil from Stony Brook Farms is the perfect complement to our Pepitas in salads and soups. So you can drizzle and shake over roasted veggies for a nutty finish. Both the oil and seeds are also a delicious addition to ice creams, custards, souffles and anything else you can imagine.\n\nCalifornia Wine and Champagne Wafers are a delightful accompaniment to every wine. Simply pop a bite into your mouth, swallow a sip of your favorite wine and voila! A little flavor explosion of lemon and vanilla, chocolate and mocha or raspberry and almond makes your evening glass into a sweet treat! These artisan wine wafers are also yummy when paired with tea, coffee, or nothing at all. So no matter which flavor you choose, you're going to love it! You can even buy all three and give it as a gift! Sample all flavors in our grocery store, so you know exactly what you're giving.\n\nTerrapin Ridge Farms offer our favorite dips, jams, mustards, and relishes. And we can hardly wait to share samples with you. Whether you're serving a veggie dish or spreading on a sandwich, these spreads are highly craved and sought after. Dress up your cream cheese or finish a chicken breast coming off the grill with Hot Pepper Bacon Jam. Mix some whipped cream cheese together with Sweet Beet and Horseradish Mustard for a simple vegetable dip. We love the spicy Mango Habanero jam and Pineapple Habanero dip. They're fantastic for spicing up marinades.\n\nAlmondina cookies are lining our shelves for the holidays. Choconut, Pistachio and Almond, Ginger Spice, Cinnamon and more are all perfect goodies to serve with coffee or tea after a meal. They would also be a wonderful surprise in someone's Christmas stocking. Watch out - these cookies are difficult to stop eating. Once the package is opened, good luck!\n\nMaple syrups from Butternut Mountain Farms are always a welcome addition during the fall and winter months. Choose from Sweet Autumn, Sweet Bourbon, Sweet Chai, and Sweet Heat flavors. All syrups are straight from Vermont and a gobsmacking addition to pancakes, marinades, meat rubs and more. Tap our Tasting Room for a taste. You may want to stock up. They're only around this time of year. And once they're gone, they're gone until next year.\n\nAs you can see, we have been busy stocking our shelves. We look forward to making your holiday gifts unique and appreciated. You can't go wrong when you shop Olive Oil Company for holiday gifts. We're the specialty grocery store near you have been looking for. Bring your friends and family for a tasting tour.

      "EVOO olive oil is not created equally. What we find on the shelves in America is often fake. How do they get away with it? Simple: EVOO olive oil isn't regulated in our country. And labels don't really tell the truth. Olive oil producers can print whatever they want for the oils they export. This makes giving an olive oil gift set a disappointment when the olive oil is no good. We know you want to gift truly fresh extra virgin olive oil, and Olive Oil Company has just what you're looking for.\n\nFlavored balsamic vinegar is just the complement to any of our southern hemisphere olive oils. And if EVOO isn't for you, we have plenty of fused and infused olive oils too. Whether your loved ones enjoy citrus, savory or spicy, our Tasting Room is loaded with options for flavor combinations. And, we can put together an olive oil gift set that is sure to dazzle tastebuds. Blood Orange and Vanilla, Chipotle and Maple, and Tuscan Herb and Red Apple are just a few fun combos. You are always welcome to mix your own pairings and select flavors on your own. Whatever you choose, we're ready to wrap gifts and send you out with your holiday shopping complete.\n\nBring your list to the grocery store near me. Our team is ready and waiting to help you knock out your holiday shopping list. We have just the olive oil gift set you want. And, if you don't see what you want, just let us know. We can help you choose just the right flavored balsamic vinegar for your olive oil gift set. Please even the pickiest palate with Olive Oil Company flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars. We've got just what you're looking for. Come taste for yourself. You can try everything before you buy it. We also have lots of jams, mustards, and olives to go with your gifts.

      "1-1/2 ounces Butter Olive Oil\n1 small onion, chopped small\n3/4 cup flour\n1-3/4 cup whole milk\n1/2 cup Blue cheese\ncrumbled flour for coating\n1 egg\nbreadcrumbs for coating\nSpanish extra virgin olive oil\n\nHeat the butter olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until tender (about 5 minutes). Slowly add the flour and mix well during 5 minutes blending well. Pour in the milk stirring a little at the time until the sauce thickens. Add the blue cheese, mix well and cook for another 2 minutes. Place this mixture in a plastic container, cover and let it cool completely. To make the croquettes, take a spoonful of the thick béchamel and shape it into a small cylinder. Repeat until you finish with all the béchamel paste. Flour the croquettes, dip them in the egg and finally into the breadcrumbs, pressing carefully all round so the croquettes get a good even coating. Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and fry the croquettes in small batches until golden. Place them in a plate with kitchen paper to absorb the excess of oil. Serve them hot. Delicious with Hot Pepper Bacon Jam.",
