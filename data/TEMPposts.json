    "Wherever you find quality olive oils, you will also find folks trying to make a dishonest buck. Don't take our word for it. Criminals have their hands in the olive oil mills, and they're passing corrupted oils to the United States. 60 Minutes ran an expose on fraud in the industry, and boy did they have our attention! Did you know that most quality olive oil comes from Spain? That's right. Most people think the best olives grow in Italy. The truth is, Spain is the world's top olive producer. While geography doesn't matter, quality really does.\n\nWhen you think of the money made from exporting olive oil, you realize no country will ever ship their best product out. They simply want to enjoy it for themselves. And that is perfectly ok. As long as the olive oil mill that produces your oil crushes unripened olives and takes proper care of the yield. When you shop with Olive Oil Company, you can rest assured your olive oils are fresh, whole and unadulterated oils. We carry the world's best exported olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Every business wants to make money. We have learned you don't have to charge a lot for quality olive oil. You just need to have a solid business model. <a href=\"http://bhooc.com\">BHOOC.com</a> has just that.\n\nThe great news about true olive oil is that is healthy and has many uses. We even convert to butter to olive oil in our baking recipes. With real olive oil, you can safely cook up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit. We grill, marinade, saute and do everything else with our oils and vinegars. Since you may be new to Olive Oil Company, you may want to check out recipes on our <a href=\"http://bhooc.com/recipes/\">website</a> or Facebook page under Olive Oil Company.\n\nWhether you are new with high quality olive oil, or have been appreciating for years, we're so glad you're shopping with, and we look forward to seeing you online soon.",

    "The range in quality of olive oil and balsamic vinegar is broad and confusing. Do we want aged oil and vinegar? Or, should our extra virgin olive oil sit around? What is Balsamic Condimento? And, if balsamic vinegar is aged, what is its shelf life?\n\nHere at, we have all had the same questions. How do you know your olive oil is fresh? Is this the real deal? Can we tell the difference between our product and the stuff at the olive oil market? Sometimes it's anyone's guess if the aged balsamic vinegar they just bought is authentic. When food isn't a part of your daily diet, you most likely don't know much about it. This happens to be the case with olive oil and <a href=\"https://bhooc.com/product-category/vinegars/\">balsamic vinegar</a>.\n\nThe Italian mafia has swindled Americans out of hundreds of billions of dollars through oil and vinegar corruption. And they get away with it because the consumer is ignorant. Once your palate is exposed to genuine aged balsamic vinegar, there is no going back. And you'll probably notice the difference right away. That stuff you're served in a restaurant can just be wine vinegar with a lot of caramel coloring. When you taste any of the top-notch balsamic vinegars in our tasting rooms, you'll notice the difference right away.\n\nWhen you're spending good money on healthy foods, it doesn't make sense to drown them in adulterated olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Adding unhealthy ingredients to our nutritious meals defeats the purpose. Part of pursuing better health is paying attention to ingredients. They can make or break your health-conscious meal planning. Stop by a tasting room to stock up on high-quality oils, vinegars and gourmet olives. We want to support your efforts to eat right and preserve good health.",

    "The world's finest Spanish olive oil is available once again. Anytime we can get the olive oil from Melgarejo or Oro Bailen farms, we know our discerning patrons will be pleased. Both olives produce an emerald green oil that is rich and viscous. This year's Spanish Picual olive oil boasts a 276.6 parts per million antioxidant count. This number qualifies the oil as a \"medium\" in terms of pungency. Hojiblanca Ultra Premium olive oil is our most \"robust\" for the season. It heralds a hearty 406.8 ppm for its biophenol count.\n\nUC Davis Olive Center has done numerous studies on the health benefits of fresh olive oil. They have reported that true extra virgin olive oils with at least a 161 ppm phenol count may drop diastolic blood pressure. We're now seeing that the olive oil with 300 ppm and above drop both blood pressure and lowers cholesterol. You can Google olive oil and blood pressure for more information. It's wonderful to know that Spanish olive oil and other oils at Olive Oil Company are fresh and healthy too! When we find good food sources, we really can use it to supplement vitamins and nutrients. Your food should be medicine for your body!\n\nIt's even better to know that all of our Ultra Premium extra virgin olive oils have traceable health benefits. For any olive oil to be considered as Ultra Premium oil, it must present at least a 139 ppm phenol count. So no matter which olive oil you purchase, they each have live antioxidants that fight free radicals. When you learn that health begins at a cellular level, it really does matter what you feed your body. For this year's Northern Hemisphere harvest, we highly recommend our world-renown Spanish olive oils. Pick up your bottle before the end of July.",

    "Drinking olive oil should be part of a healthy diet if it really is good for us. But do we really want to drink olive oil? When I first heard about the idea, I wasn't too keen. However, different types of olive oil have been proven to improve human health. Olive oil that's pressed from unripened olives maintains healthy antioxidants. Olive oil for cooking should be fresh and full of nutrition. Whether you are drinking olive oil or using olive oil for cooking, make sure your source is solid. Experts have found much of the oils imported to the U.S. is actually canola oil. Imagine pouring that down your gullet! If you're seriously considering drinking olive oil for health, consult your physician first.\n\nConsuming adulterated olive oil can be harmful to your health. We have all read how different types of olive oil are good for different purposes. Have you thought of the reality that not all olive oils are equal? It's not pleasant to think that someone is selling us a poor quality product and calling it olive oil. But it happens. And it happens more than we think. Imagine what drinking canola oil would do to your health. We're pretty sure that's not what you have in mind when you think of drinking olive oil.\n\nSo what's the solution to this problem? All we can recommend is that you know your sources. Olive Oil Company makes every effort to preserve all the nutrition in all our products. Good olive oil with antioxidants can be a very healthy part of your daily diet. If you're consuming healthful oil, you're ahead of a lot of people. Just using olive oil for cooking can promote heart and vascular health. As Americans, we can all use a little help in those areas. Anything you can do to improve your health is a smart move, and we're glad to be on the journey with you.",
