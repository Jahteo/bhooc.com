  description: "Zesty, fragrant Persian Lime essential oil is married with Certified Ultra Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil in this delightful and versatile infused olive oil. Use it almost anywhere! It can lend dramatic flavor to both sweet and savory applications. Think tea cake, biscotti, salad dressings, marinades, drizzled over vegetables, in cakes, for homemade mayonnaise, aioli, and granola. Use it to take your recipe to the next flavor dimension. Weâ€™ve also found it to be fantastic with fish, poultry, ceviche, Latin inspired recipes, salsa and more.",
