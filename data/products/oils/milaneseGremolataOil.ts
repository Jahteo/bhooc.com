  description: "Certified Ultra Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil is infused with Gremolata - a traditional Italian herbal condiment consisting of fresh lemon zest, minced garlic, Italian flat leaf parsley, & a hint of mint. The herbs and citrus zest are typically crushed together in a mortar to release their pungent essential oils. Try finishing your fish with this exciting flavor combination. It is also traditionally served with osso buco, veal, and other slow braised dishes to add a zip of flavor. We also recommend our Gremolata for marinating poultry and in dressings.",
