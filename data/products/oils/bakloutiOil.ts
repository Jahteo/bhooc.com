  description: "From the Barbary Coast of North Africa, this Tunisian Baklouti Pepper is rare and unique to this region. This fused oil is the only example of this fruity and spicy green chili olive oil in the world. Baklouti chili olive oil is made by combining fresh, early harvest organic olives with an almost equal ratio of fresh, whole green Baklouti chilies. The two, and only two, ingredients are then crushed together, mixed in the malaxer which fuses the fresh green essential oil of the pepper with the organic olive oil. Baklouti adds a savory, tantalizing kick to salsa marinades, soups, grilled foods, vegetables, and more.",
