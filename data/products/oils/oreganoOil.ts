  description: "Made with fresh oregano crushed with early harvest, fresh picked Greek olives, using 100% mechanical cold extraction methods. Fresh, bright, and herbaceous, this is by far one of the most difficult flavors to translate into an oil because the essential oil oregano rarely, if ever, tastes like the fresh herb, whereas this cold pressed agrumanto oregano is spot on. We are amazed on how beautiful this oil has turned out, it has pulled out the earthly and delicate flavors of the oregano creating an amazing fused oil. Fantastic anywhere youâ€™d like the fresh herbaceous flavor of oregano. Use in marinades, salads, for bread dipping, brushed on vegetables, with poultry and more.",
