  description: "Spicy and floral with notes of fresh ground peppercorn and a lingering, tingly Szechuan peppercorn finish. Great for marinades, dressings, aioli, sautâ€€ing, and over ice cream. Try it in a cream based dish, or in a salad for a nice peppery zing. Amazing on popcorn, with creamy pasta, and seafood. Create that amazing peppercorn flavor in your favorite dishes without having to use fresh peppercorns!",
