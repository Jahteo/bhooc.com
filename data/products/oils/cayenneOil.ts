  description: "Made at our certified organic mill in Tunisia, this oil is made with whole cayenne peppers crushed with certified organic Tunisian olives. This fused oil is concentrated and has a delightful aroma. It’s “hot-sweet” with rich flavor of ripened peppers full of floral and fruity notes. The lovely color is indicative of the abundant amount of whole, fresh peppers we picked and crushed with the olives. Use as a condiment to kick up your potatoes, roasted vegetables, marinades, and dipping sauces.",
