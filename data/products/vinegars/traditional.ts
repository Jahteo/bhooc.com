  description: "Our finest grade of aged balsamic condimento from Modena, Italy is produced in the Traditional Style. It is aged using the Solera System for up to 18 years in chestnut, oak, mulberry and ash barrels. With 4% acidity, it exceeds Four Leaf Quality with an astonishingly high density of 1.28+. This spectacular density comes naturally without thickeners or added sugar, from a lengthy aging process and cooking in copper kettles. It is exceedingly rich, complex and dense and pairs beautifully with any olive oil in our collection.",
