  description: "Made with White Trebbiano Grape Must, our White Peach Balsamic undergoes the cooking and barrel aging process of Balsamic vinegar of Modena but is not caramelized, therefore it retains its white color. The result is a crisp vinegar with a touch of sweetness reminiscent of hand crafted vinegars of Northern Italy. Itâ€™s a great addition in marinades, salsa and ice cream.",
