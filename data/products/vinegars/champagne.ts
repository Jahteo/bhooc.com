  description: "When you first taste our Champagne White Wine Vinegar, you’ll instantly fall in love with its smooth and elegant flavor. That’s due in part to the way in which it is produced. Unlike other champagne vinegars, this one never undergoes a pasteurization process. By eliminating this step, the vinegar possesses a lovely, rich base. Imported from the Champagne region of France, the vinegar is a divine ingredient in salads, or try in homemade mayonnaise; simply whisk with extra virgin olive oil, eggs and mustard.",
