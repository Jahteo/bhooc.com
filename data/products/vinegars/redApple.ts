  description: "This balsamic has an enticing aroma and a delicate, sweet apple flavor, fruitier than most balsamic vinegars. Itâ€™s a wonderful way of adding aroma and taste to compliment any dish. It adds a refreshing lift to salads, sauces, chutneys and vegetables. It is amazing drizzled on pork, chicken or fish. Mix equally with our Mushroom and Sage Ultra Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil and shake well, for a knock-out vinaigrette dressing.",
