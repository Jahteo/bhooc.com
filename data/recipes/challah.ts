  "ingredients": [
    "<h4>1⁄2 cup fresh orange juice (from about 2 medium oranges)",
    "2 1⁄4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)",
    "1⁄3 cup Blood Orange olive oil",
    "3 large eggs, at room temperature",
    "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature",
    "3 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon grated orange or lemon zest, to taste (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "3 to 3 1⁄2 cups bread flour, plus more for kneading dough</h4><h4>In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine orange juice and 1 tablespoon water. Sprinkle yeast over top and let sit until frothy, about 5 minutes.</h4><h4>Add Blood Orange olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 yolk, the sugar, the salt and the zest, if using, and beat with a dough hook until just combined. Add in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together into a sticky mass. You may or may not use all of the flour, so at the end, add it gradually. The dough should come away from the sides of the bowl but not be at all stiff. You’re looking for a slightly sticky, soft dough.</h4><h4>Transfer dough to floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl and turn the dough over. Cover bowl with a clean dish towel and let rise in a draft-free place until doubled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Press down dough to expel all the air, cover bowl and let rise for another 45 minutes.</h4><h4>In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water and set aside. Cut dough into three equal pieces and roll them each into ropes 12 inches long. Braid them into a loaf, tucking the edges under. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet, then brush with egg wash. Let rise uncovered for 45 minutes.</h4><h4>Heat oven to 375 degrees with a rack in the middle. Gently brush a second coat of egg wash on the dough, bake for 25 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before serving.</h4>"
