    "In the meantime, mix the remaining ingredients together. When eggs are cooled, peel, slice in half lengthwise and scoop out the yolks. ",
    "Blend in yolks in with the above mixture. This can be done by putting all ingredients into a sealable plastic bag and kneading it with your hands. Snip one corner of the plastic bag and use it as a decorating tube to fill the egg halves. ",
