    "<b>Quinoa </b>is a nutrient-dense grain, which contains all 9 essential amino acids. It provides a good source of dietary fiber, is high in protein, and offers a good source of vitamins and minerals. Quinoa can be found in three varieties: red, black, and white – white being the most common. ",
    "<b>Couscous </b>is a type of small pasta made out of semolina flour. Couscous comes in several sizes and sometimes colors. Although lower in calories than quinoa, traditional couscous is often made from refined flour, which lacks nutrients, however, there are varieties made with whole wheat flour. ",
    "Directions In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegars, lemon zest, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper; set aside. ",
    "In a separate bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, bell pepper, and kalamata olives. Add the vinaigrette and mix well. Add feta cheese, garbanzo beans, and quinoa and gently mix. Place on top of lettuce greens or eat on its own."
