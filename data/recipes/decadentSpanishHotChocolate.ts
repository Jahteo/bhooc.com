Raspberry Dark Balsamic</div><div>1 tsp. cocoa powder</div><div>2 tsp. Chipotle Olive Oil</div><div>1 cup cold water</div><div></div><div align=\"left\">Whisk together cocoa powder, sugar and corn starch in a small saucepan.</div><div align=\"left\">Pour Raspberry Balsamic, Chipotle Olive Oil, &amp; cold water into cocoa mixture and start cooking at medium low heat, stirring constantly. Cook until it thickens and serve immediately in two small mugs.</div><div align=\"left\"></div><div align=\"left\">Bonus: Dip churros, French toast, or Almondina cookies into the super thick chocolate for an extra treat. Recipe can easily be doubled or tripled, but be sure to still serve in small mugs as it is supremely rich, especially without milk or cream. Also try with Pomegranate Balsamic &amp; Butter Olive Oil or with Cinnamon-Pear Balsamic &amp; Blood Orange Olive Oil.</div>"
