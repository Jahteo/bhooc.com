  "ingredients": [
    "1-1/2 ounces Butter Olive Oil",
    "1 small onion, chopped small",
    "3/4 cup flour",
    "1-3/4 cup whole milk",
    "1/2 cup Blue cheese",
    "crumbled flour for coating",
    "1 egg",
    "breadcrumbs for coating",
    "Spanish extra virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Heat the butter olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until tender (about 5 minutes). Slowly add the flour and mix well during 5 minutes blending well. Pour in the milk stirring a little at the time until the sauce thickens. Add the blue cheese, mix well and cook for another 2 minutes. Place this mixture in a plastic container, cover and let it cool completely. To make the croquettes, take a spoonful of the thick béchamel and shape it into a small cylinder. Repeat until you finish with all the béchamel paste. Flour the croquettes, dip them in the egg and finally into the breadcrumbs, pressing carefully all round so the croquettes get a good even coating. Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and fry the croquettes in small batches until golden. Place them in a plate with kitchen paper to absorb the excess of oil. Serve them hot. Delicious with Hot Pepper Bacon Jam."
