Our mildest olive oil boasts a 242.7 biophenol count, and that's exciting for olive oil lovers everywhere. We have learned that live antioxidants promote heart health and help fight chronic diseases. Did you know you can lower your blood pressure and cholesterol with unripened olive oil? UC Davis Olive Center is a wealth of information if you'd like to know more.",
