    "Wherever you find quality olive oils, you will also find folks trying to make a dishonest buck. Don't take our word for it. Criminals have their hands in the olive oil mills, and they're passing corrupted oils to the United States. 60 Minutes ran an expose on fraud in the industry, and boy did they have our attention! Did you know that most quality olive oil comes from Spain? That's right. Most people think the best olives grow in Italy. The truth is, Spain is the world's top olive producer. While geography doesn't matter, quality really does.",
